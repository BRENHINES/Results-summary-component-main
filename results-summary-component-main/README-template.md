### What I learned

I learn how to properly use linear-gradient in a background. But also how to use box-shadow.

```css
background: linear-gradient(to bottom, color_1, color_2);
```
```css
box-shadow: x-direction y-direction shadow-width shadow-blur color;
```

### Continued development

I want to continous to focus on CSS especially in linear-gradient such as this one which i make.
